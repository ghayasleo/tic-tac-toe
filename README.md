# Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game that involves strategy and decision-making. In this project, we aim to enhance the traditional Tic Tac Toe experience by incorporating a machine learning algorithm to predict the botâ€™s movements. By doing so, we can create a more challenging and dynamic game for players.

## Literature Review

Our research indicates that existing Tic Tac Toe implementations primarily rely on rule-based bots that follow predefined strategies. However, these bots often lack adaptability and fail to provide an engaging experience. Machine learning approaches, such as reinforcement learning or decision trees, offer the potential to create more intelligent opponents.

## Resources

We will utilize the following tools and technologies:

1. **Python:** For coding and implementing the ML model.
2. **scikit-learn:** For ML algorithms.
3. **Pygame:** For game development.
